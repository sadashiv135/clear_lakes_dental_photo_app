# Instructions

Most of your work can be done in the app.vue file.
For interacting with APIs, you can use [composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables) or leave it in app.vue.

You can do all of your development in 'app.vue', or you can get more advanced by:

- Using Vue and Nuxt's [page/components system](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/app/pages)
- Practicing proper environment safety via Nuxt's [Server API Routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch)
